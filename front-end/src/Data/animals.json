				"about": "The Quincy Animal Shelter is a 100% volunteer-run organization. The Shelter relies completely on our volunteers and the community for support. Incorporated in November 1999 as a non-profit Massachusetts charity, we are also a recognized charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Service code. Since 1999 the Quincy Animal Shelter has placed more than 7,500 cats and dogs into loving and forever homes throughout MA and New England.\n\nAs a \"no kill\" shelter, we make every effort to find the right home for every animal in our care. Every animal receives age-appropriate vaccinations, micro-chipped, and is spayed or neutered before finding its forever family. \n\nDelivering this type of care involves many volunteers, an active and dedicated management and Board, and a lot of money. Our budget runs approximately $250,000 every year in order to keep doing what we do to help the dogs and cats of Quincy. \n\nPlease visit our Volunteer and Wish List pages to find out about ways you can help. Our capacity at the Shelter is limited to a maximum of 12 dogs and 15 to 25 cats, depending on ages and condition of the cats. Our dream is to eventually have a larger facility so that we can continue our mission on a larger scale and serve the continuous needs of the community and the animals.",

				"adoptionProcess": "The first step to adopting is to fill out the Online Adoption Application  at www.rosesrescue.net. After your application has been reviewed and approved, one of our volunteers will get in touch with you. As long as your application has been pre-approved, the pet's foster parent will set up a time with you to come visit the pet you're interested in. In some cases, a home visit may also be required. If all goes well, you will then sign an adoption contract, pay the adoption fee, and then your new pet is ready to go to its forever home!\n\nDogs\nAdoption Fees:\nMixed Breed: $125\nPrison Trained Dogs: $145\nPurebred: $150 no papers $165 w\/papers\n\nAll dogs will be current on shots (EXCEPT Rabies), and be spayed or neutered (if not of age they will come with a certificate to be done within 14 days after coming of age).\n\nCats\nAdoption Fees:\nThe adoption fee for cats is $75.\n\nCats are spayed or neutered (or come with the certificate)and UTD on shots (except for Rabies) and are aids and Leukemia tested.",
				"about": "A small group of volunteers..no paid employees. Our dogs are in area foster homes or they are housed at Rose's..in a heated pole building with a \"bedroom\" (toddler beds, a chair and a radio..so they can keep up on current events) with a dog door to a small fenced area to potty in through out the day and night. Then they get to play in a four acre fenced in area and swim in the pond every day too! We do not have a \"shelter\" per se and only under special circumstances are any of our animals \"kenneled\". They are very well socialized with people and other animals, which makes it much easier to know their temperaments. We do NOT take owner surrenders. But we will do courtesy posts for pets that are vetted and in need of homes. OUR MISSION STATEMENT Rose's Rescue is an all breed rescue for dogs and cats. We primarily concentrate on local pound rescues as we feel these are the animals in the most dire need of a second chance. We are committed to finding the best possible home for each, and every animal that comes into our rescue and we are available to help with any training or behavioral issues for the life of each animal. Rose's Rescue requires that any animal adopted through our organization be returned to us if for any reason the family is no longer able to care for them. Rose's Rescue is also committed to educating the public on the importance of spay and neuter, routine vaccinations, heartworm protection for dogs, and aids and leukemia testing for cats. According to the Humane Society of American over 4 million dogs, cats, kittens and puppies are killed each year. It is our goal to some day see no adoptable pets euthanized.\nEvery two months, Rose\u2019s Rescue chooses a few special candidates for a new class of dogs to be trained at the Trumbull Correctional Institution near Warren, Ohio.  While enrolled in this program, each dog will be trained by selected inmates and overseen by professional dog trainer Bill Oliver (www.customcaninecompany.com) who generously volunteers his time with this laudable project.  Upon completion of their training, cell dogs will have learned important socialization skills, have mastered basic obedience commands, and be fully housebroken.  They will also be taught tricks to entertain their future families and friends, such as sitting pretty, playing dead, and give a high five.  All dogs can be visited (by appointment and accompanied by a Rose\u2019s Rescue representative) while at the prison.  They can be adopted upon graduation, or occasionally sooner if a dog has done exceptionally well and is deemed ready to leave before the class is actually finished.  All of our current cell dogs or graduates are designated as such in their individual descriptions in the \u201cOur Adoptables\u201d section of this website.  If you\u2019d like to get a jump-start on training your new pet, consider adopting a Rose\u2019s Rescue cell dog! ",

				"about": "Paws for Seniors is an all volunteer rescue group in Fauquier County, VA.\nDedicated to caring for and finding homes for senior dogs and cats, aged seven years and older where they can live out their golden years with dignity and love through rescue, foster, adoption, and hospice.\n\nThe Problem\nFor any number of reasons senior dogs and cats are given up by, in many cases, the only family they have ever known.  More often then not, they end up in animal shelters.\nOur Philosophy & Goals\nWe  believe that senior  dogs and cats   deserve a safe and caring environment in which to live out their golden years. We formed, Paws For Seniors, to help find these homeless pets a home where they can live out their remaining days with love and dignity.\nWe do not believe that we are \u0093in competition\u0094 with rescue groups and shelters but \u0093in concert\u0094.  We all have the same goal of helping animals in distress, caring for them, and finding \u0093furever\u0094 homes.   \nWe believe that pet companionship is key to keeping our aging society young at heart! We will work to match senior dogs & cats with senior citizens, while considering the needs of  both.\nWe will work with rescues\/shelters to network and cross-post Senior Dogs and Cats in their care to aid in finding a permanent home.\nWe will establish a network of foster homes, including Senior Citizens to provide a safe and caring environment for pets in need while waiting for their forever homes.  This would be a win-win situation for seniors that would love a pet but cannot afford the expense.  The foster home provides the love and daily care to a Senior Dog or Cat in need. \u0093Paws For Seniors\u0094 provides the food, pet meds and vet care while looking for a forever home.  In some cases our Foster Home providers may become \u0093permanent\u0094 fosters.\nWe will establish a program to aid Senior Citizens to keep the companionship of the pets they currently have.\nWe will work to bring awareness and educate the public on humane animal welfare issues.",

All pets have their basic vaccinations, have been spayed\/neutered and microchipped. An adoption counselor interviews the potential adopting family, then has them complete the application.",

We helped the Rockwall shelter become no kill and we are now proud to say that we take in more dogs and cats from Dallas Animal Services than any other organization. Our fosters are passionate about saving lives. We have a robust transport program and we drive dogs to our partners around the country to help with the overpopulation in Texas. Our mission is to save every precious life possible.",
