An USERL volunteer will contact them to discuss the horse and put them in contact with the foster home. Once the potential adopter, foster home and the appropriate USERL Regional Director and\/or Executive Director agree that the horse and adopter is a match, USERL will schedule a barn check.  An USERL volunteer will schedule a time to meet you at your barn. S\/he will be looking for safety (i.e. no barbed wire, no junk in the pastures), a clean, healthy environment and the condition and temperament of your other horses, if any.  Depending on how quickly you can get out to meet the equine and how quickly we can get a volunteer to do your barn check, typically the process takes one week to one month.\r\nComplete and return the USERL Preliminary Adoption Application.  We will then contact you directly if we have additional questions. \r\nIf the personal interview is satisfactory and if the USERL has a potentially suitable equine at the time, the USERL will schedule an appointment to check the potential adopter's facilities. In addition, the USERL will also conduct interviews of the references provided by the potential adopter on the Preliminary Adoption Application. \r\nUpon satisfactory completion of the above, USERL will schedule a working session with the potential equine to determine if this is a suitable match. \r\nUpon the completion of the session, it will be determined whether or not the equine and potential adopter are compatible. The USERL may at that time require additional sessions.  \r\nFacility requirement: The facility shall have at least a roof and three sides and be in good repair and free of standing water. The equine must be allowed a minimum of 4 hours of daily turn out in a suitable and safe fenced area.  Barbed wire is not accepted by the USERL. The USERL requests that the adopted equine be kept with a companion equine or other compatible large herd animal. \r\nWhen all requirements and preliminary adoption procedures have been satisfied, the USERL will require the following at the time of final adoption:\r\nCompletion of a permanent Adoption Contract detailing the care, which is required for the individual equines being adopted.    \r\nPayment in full of an adoption fee (non-refundable after 30 days), which is based upon each individual equine, and set by the USERL at its sole discretion. \r\nThe USERL reserves the right to conduct unscheduled follow-up on the Adopted Animal and the facility at the USERL's discretion. If either are found to be in unsatisfactory condition, attempts will be made to help the adopters remedy the situation.  If these attempts are unsuccessful, the USERL retains the right to repossess the adopted equine at any time.  The USERL may require the adopter to submit to them receipt of proof of required veterinary and farrier care and\/or an annual health statement from the adopter's veterinarian and farrier.",

We treat all treatable conditions, and find homes.

Our goal is to make \"perfect\" matches so that our animals remain with their new guardians for the remainder of their lives. Here at SVACA we use the ASPCA\u2019s Meet Your Match program in order to attempt to \"match\" prospective adopters with the best possible dog or cat. Other animals are also appropriately matched with their new guardians.\r\n\r\nAppointments are recommended as a way to avoid long waits that are sometimes experienced at other shelters, but we do accept walk-ins on a first come, first served basis. To expedite the process, prospective adopters should bring the following with them: \r\n\r\n1.  Photo ID: driver\u2019s license or valid state ID\r\n\r\n2.  Proof of residency: current utility bill or lease agreement \r\n\r\n3.  Proof of ownership: mortgage statement \r\n\r\n4. Pet policy at residence: leasing agreement with pet stipulation\r\nand\/or contact information\r\n\r\n5.  All human members of the household\r\n\r\n6.  Dogs(s) as directed by SVACA staff\r\n\r\nPlease note that animals cannot be placed on hold until you have interacted with an animal during your appointment. \r\n\r\nNOTE: Please do not bring pets to the Center unless you have been instructed to do so by SVACA staff. \r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\nFees cover the spay or neuter of the animal, initial appropriate vaccinations, a professional health examination and behavior evaluation, microchip, temporary ID tag, and a free examination at a participating local veterinary clinic.  SVACA member city residents also receive a license for their new companion.  All fees are retained by SVACA and used to offset the cost of our operations; simply said, fees directly help the animals!\r\n\r\nDog\/Cat $100.00 \r\nRabbit $30.00 \r\nSmall Animal  $20.00 \r\nBird $20.00 \r\nDog Training Deposit*  $100.00 \r\n\r\n\r\n* Required for all pit bulls and pit mixes; all dogs under 2 years\r\n\r\nCall us at (408) 764-0344 for more information or to make an appointment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "adoptionProcess": "The first step is to fill out an adoption application, answering some basic questions about yourself and your household.  This will help the adoption counselors facilitate the matchmaking process.  Most adoptions take at least 45 minutes to one hour to complete.  The Adoption Center is a busy place, so please be patient and allow yourself enough time for our process.  THANK YOU!\r\n\r\nWhat we will need to know when you adopt a new companion:\r\n\r\nIf you own your home, please bring some item of verification (tax bill, water bill, or mortgage statement.)  Please also be sure to check your homeowner\u2019s insurance policy.  Some policies restrict coverage for certain dog breeds.\r\n\r\nIf you DO NOT own your place of residence, please be sure the property owner will consent to have a pet on his\/her property.  We will verify with landlords over the phone before sending a new companion home, so please have the appropriate name and phone number available.\r\n\r\nOther pets already living with you will need to be up-to-date on vaccination.  This is to decrease the risk of spreading infectious disease from one animal to another.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that your new companion will be a member of your family.  This can mean a \r\n10-15 year commitment from you!  Please bring along family members so we can make sure it will be a good match before you make a commitment.  Also, if adopting a second dog, please bring your current dog with you---we can let them spend some time together and give you some suggestions on surviving the adjustment period.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure you have considered the financial obligation involved in caring for a companion animal.  This includes routine veterinary and emergency care, in addition to food, supplies and training.  The adoption counselors can give you an idea of basic costs involved for each type of animal.\r\n\r\nMany animals adopted from shelters can require an immediate visit to the veterinarian.  Because of the volume of un-vaccinated animals entering a shelter\u2019s care, the risk of transmissible contagious diseases can be quite high.  Kennel cough in dogs, and upper respiratory infections in cats are the two most common diseases that your newly adopted companion may experience.  You must ask yourself if you have the financial means to care for your new friend, beyond the initial adoption costs.\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU COMMIT!!!!!  Please be honest with yourself about the actual time you have to train, groom, and exercise the companion animal you have chosen.  Some things to consider: Do you work long or erratic hours?  Do you like outdoor activity?  Who will care for your pet while you travel?  Will your pet be the appropriate size when he or she is full grown?  When adopting into a home with children:  Are you adopting to teach your child responsibility, or are your adopting because you have a responsible child?  Are your children comfortable around the animal you\u2019ve chosen?  Will YOU still remain committed to this animal when the children lose interest?  Take the time now to consider these things and find the best match for your lifestyle!\r\n\r\nWe thank your for offering your home to a \u201cpre-loved\u201d companion.  We hope he or she will be a wonderful addition to your family and your home!\r\n",
        "about": "The Thomas J. O'Connor Animal Control and Adoption Center provides comprehensive animal control services and programs to our communities for the protection of animals, public health and safety, and the environment. \r\n\r\nThe Thomas J. O\u2019Connor facility believes in providing a second chance to animals that are not reclaimed by an owner. Our center has a full-service adoption service, a service rarely offered through municipal animal control programs. TJO has an in-house veterinarian two days per week, responsible for shelter animal wellness and sterilization surgery. Adoptable animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated and screened for other health concerns.  Each animal is then placed into the adoption area to await a new home. Every animal is microchipped at the time of adoption.",
