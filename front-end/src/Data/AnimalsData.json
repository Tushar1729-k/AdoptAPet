See, I was a stray kitten who was taken in by a nice lady and when she took me to the vet for my spa day, her landlord found out and told her I wasn't allowed to come back. We were both heartbroken, but that's how I wound up here. It's way better than the streets, but I sure wish another nice lady (or man) would come along and give me another chance at having a home to call my own.

  "description": "<div class=\"rgDescription\">Dave is a social butterfly who loves to play and snuggle in close to his people, and has never met a human he didn't like. On top of being Mr. Popular, he'd also make a great candidate for Class Clown with his enthusiastic and playful nature. He loves to go on walks and romps with his friends at the shelter and then settle in for some serious cuddle time and scritches. Dave has lived in a home before and picked up some impressive manners. He walks nicely on leash, is fully house-trained and sleeps quietly through the night in his crate. He can also be left home without issue for eight-hour stretches. Although he hasn't lived with children, he has been noted to be playful, tolerant and easygoing with kids over the age of 6 that he's interacted with. He's lived successfully with a dog before, and as long as feeding time is properly managed, he should do okay with a well-matched doggie sibling. Dave is also in APA!'s Total Obedience Program. The Total Obedience Program (TOP) is modeled after the AKC's Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. As a TOP dog, Dave has a personalized training plan and works with a volunteer trainer several times a week to help him learn the skills to become the best dog he can be! Dave is learning skills like sit and down, walking nicely on leash, sitting calmly when approached by strangers or other dogs, staying in a sit or down until told \"free,\" coming when called and \"Place\", which means he will go to a specific place in your home on command. Once he successfully completes all the skills on his training plan, Dave will be considered TOP Dog Ready! Dave is working hard to become a wonderful companion, and as a part of APA's Total Obedience Program you can work with APA staff to continue to build a training relationship with Dave after adoption and master all the TOP dog skills together. Check out a video on APA's CGC program, on which the TOP was based: https:\/\/vimeo.com\/89434193 Obedient and eager to please, Dave would be a great fit for any number of loving homes. Come meet this sweet boy and see if he's perfect for yours!<img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?17283926&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>",

She jumps with excitement when she hears that they're praising her, and she wants to be close to them and get their petting and belly rubs. She also loves making friends with dogs, a little shy at first and then wanting to play all day. And she's even interested in cats she sees on the long walks she enjoys every day. At her foster home, this playful girl loves running in the yard, playing with dog buddies who come visit and chasing flying bugs. Then she'll play with her chew toys and enjoy taking naps in her doggy bed, falling asleep on her back with her legs open. So adorable! She already understands \"sit\" and is working on her manners, learning to pause her jumping. She's also house-trained and sleeps in her crate overnight. And she does well there when her fosters are away. This sweet, energetic girl will love a home with parents who can take her for those walks she loves and continue her training. She'll also enjoy a lively doggie playmate. Come meet this butterfly. Offer her a walk and she'll stroll home with you!<img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?17283929&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>",

  "description": "<div class=\"rgDescription\">If you are looking for a friend to join you on your adventures, look no further than this charming girl, Punkin. She is just a baby, but you can already see that she is up for fun and action. She loves playing with her three brothers and two sisters. In foster care, they had an interesting birth. Their momma went under a shed to give birth and refused to bring them out - until a rainy downpour came and their foster mom rescued all of them from flooding, moving them into the house. Now, her siblings follow her around just to see what fun she is going to discover. She also loves finding a favorite toy, getting in a soft bed, and giving the toy a good chew. She is an extra pretty little thing with a soft coat. Her special talent is getting and giving kisses. The little sweetie is happy and healthy, and she has a lovely, balanced personality. She is very loving and enjoys being cuddled. This lovable little lass is a prize and is going to make someone the best \"Good Girl\" ever. Come meet this charming doll today!<img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?17283936&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>",

  "description": "<div class=\"rgDescription\">Purity was born to a very loving and attentive mother, in her foster mom's home. She is a well-adjusted, curious and sweet puppy who loves to be loved. She is a smart and obedient young puppy who loves to play with her sister and chew toys, and she also loves to chase her foster mom when outside. She is very friendly and loves to be held, petted and played with. She has the cutest fat little paws and is a decent size for a young girl. It's unknown how big she'll end up or what breed she'll look like. Her mother is a 20 lb. terrier\/pit mix. She's the perfect candidate for genetic testing if you're curious. Purity isn't super hyper. She plays at a normal pace and eats in a relaxed way. Her mother LOVES walks, and she's likely to enjoy that too once she's older. Like her mother, she really pays attention to her surroundings. She'll look up and around and sniff her surroundings. She's just discovered how the wind will blow the leaves on trees and she's fascinated! She already comes when called. Purity will do great in a home where she can feel safe and loved. Keeping her occupied with toys and walks (once she's vaccinated and old enough) will be important. Like her very loving mother, Purity will be a great companion and a beautiful dog. If you're up for offering consistent training in a loving, calm home, Purity is your girl. Her foster loves her very much and cannot wait to help find her life partner!<img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?17283937&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>",

  "description": "<div class=\"rgDescription\">Sumac was born to a very loving and attentive mother in her foster's home. She is a well-adjusted, curious and sweet puppy who loves to be loved. She is a smart and obedient puppy who loves to play with her sister and chew toys, and she also loves to chase her foster mom when outside. She is very friendly and loves to be held, petted and played with. She has the cutest fat little paws and is a decent size for her very young age. Her coloring resembles a German Shepherd, but it's unknown how big she'll be or what breed she'll look like. Her mother is a 20-lb terrier\/pit mix. She's the perfect candidate for a genetic test if you're curious. Sumac isn't super hyper. She plays at what seems to be a normal pace. She also eats in a relaxed way. Her mother LOVES walks, and she'll no doubt like that too once she's older. Like her mother, she really pays attention to her surroundings. She'll look up and around as well as sniff her surroundings. She's just discovered how the wind blows leaves on the tree, and she's fascinated! She already comes when called and has begun her potty training. Sumac will do great in a home where she can feel safe and loved. Keeping her occupied with toys and walks (once she's vaccinated and old enough) will be important. Like her very loving mother, she will be a great companion and a beautiful dog. If you're up for offering consistent training in a loving, calm home, Sumac is your girl. Her foster loves her very much and cannot wait to help her find her life partner!<img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?17283938&a=&h=\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>",

He grew up with two other litters in his foster home, and they are one big happy family. They also grew up around two resident adult cats and a dog, so they definitely know how to get along in a big family! If you are considering adopting a pair, please ask us about this amazing family, and we can suggest the perfect pair for you. They are all adorable and love each other! Hood River has the most captivating face and the most beautiful spotted orange tabby \"leopard\" coat.

All APA! cats are fully vetted, spayed or neutered, and have updated vaccines and a microchip. Lifetime support is offered by our Cat Behavior Team.
