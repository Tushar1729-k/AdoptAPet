Jewels loves her Hooves to chew on and helps her with her teething. We recommend that you have them in your home, only one of them will last for weeks. She is not leashed trained yet, so you will have to work on that. Jewels doesn&rsquo;t mind cats but she is curious and will sniff them. Jewels is very smart and catches on quickly, so training hasn&rsquo;t been too hard. Remember that she is a puppy and will still need more training, but she would make a great addition to any family that likes to be active.<\/p>\n\n<p>SECURE FENCING REQUIRED FOR ALL OF OUR RESCUED DOGS.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you are considering adopting a dog through HALO Here are some helpful hints:<\/p>\n\n<p>Bring pictures of your yard to show secure fencing.

I&rsquo;m super friendly and affectionate with people and being held is one of my favorite pastimes. I love to lay in your lap! &nbsp;I&rsquo;m also all about PLAY! &nbsp;I like to get all the toys out of the toy box and spread them all over the room and then zoom around pouncing and flipping into them. Playing ball outside is always fun for me too. I can be an only child or have a sweet and fun dog to play with in my new home as I love other dogs. I do not require lots of exercise, so you can sit back and watch me play or we can go for walks and play in the yard. I am very flexible. When you want me to be calm, just pick me up and I&rsquo;ll fall fast asleep in your lap. &nbsp;We are working on potty training. &nbsp;I totally have the peeing part down and only go outside, but do to my injury I still poop sometimes when I start running around. It is really easy to clean up and I am doing better. I must stay slim to protect my back, so not too many treats for me please. I am learning to go upstairs with carpet, but I don&rsquo;t even try to come down the stairs. The good thing is I am small enough to be picked up and carried up or down stairs. I&#39;m good in my crate or puppy playpen and just a wonderful young pup! I am a very special puppy! Someone probably kicked me as a 6 week old puppy but now life is good and I can&rsquo;t wait to find my new family. I will bring lots of laughter into the home. You can contact Tammy for more information about me at 770-314-8974. &nbsp;My best friend is Izzy who also has a back issue, so if you happen to want 2 wonderful special needs doggies, MM&#39;s will let you adopt both of us for one adoption fee. &nbsp;Energy level: &nbsp;4 &ndash; 6. &nbsp;I&#39;m spayed, micro-chipped and current on my vaccinations. &nbsp;My adoption fee is $275.00. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><img src=\"https:\/\/tracker.rescuegroups.org\/pet?10000233\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>",

Though she is not overly talkative, this little girl is already the queen of the flock, and needs to have everything just her way.  Niah loves to play with toys and foster siblings, but she\u2019ll settle for anything that moves.  She has also adopted two adult foster siblings as her parents, and will spend hours snuggled into their long fur getting some quality love.  Niah is also happy to cuddle on her humans, and is a huge fan of warm laps on cool nights.  Niah cuddles both in and out of the covers, but watch where you sit, because this little girl will burrow her way into a balled up blanket to nap, and could easily get herself squished!  Niah is not a big fan of being held, though her foster home has been working on this with treats, and will squirm like crazy unless she has been napping.

        "descriptionHtml": "<p>This handsome little guy is an absolute doll. At 9 months and 8 lbs, he&rsquo;s a well-adjusted puppy with lots of Rattie personality. Although he came to New Rattitude with the name Fritz, his high jump has earned him the nickname Jumpin&rsquo; Jack Flash, or Jack for short. His favorite things to do, in order, are: snuggle with Foster Mom, eat, play with his canine foster siblings, play in the yard, snuggle with Foster Mom, eat, go for a walk, play with his toys, snuggle with Foster Mom, and sleep in the big bed with everyone...and snuggling with Foster Mom, of course. In spite of a lot of changes in his young life, Fritz is a happy, well-behaved boy with the energy of a puppy out to explore his world. He&rsquo;s a quick study, who has learned to sit and stay, and even wait, however briefly, for his food. He loves food! He&rsquo;s gotten comfortable with leash walking and exploring the neighborhood. He&rsquo;s learned to potty outside, and he&rsquo;s almost 100 percent reliable on a schedule. He is even learning to give signals that he wants to go out. He sleeps through the night without any accidents, and as long as his foster mom is in bed, he won&rsquo;t budge from her side. He is a good traveler and does well in the car on family outings. He is OK in his crate, but seems to have a little separation anxiety if he is left in the crate while his foster mom is out. He&rsquo;s really glad when she gets home and makes sure she knows it by jumping up and down with joy! Because Jack is so attached to his person, he would probably be fine as an only dog, but he would likely be happiest with another canine sibling to play with. He can&rsquo;t quite figure out who the cat is, but he barks at her. Since he does love to chase squirrels and birds, he might be better off in a feline-free zone. He&rsquo;s a little shy of people when he first meets them but warms up quickly, especially if treats are involved (see &ldquo;eat&rdquo; in favorite things above). Fritz is looking for his &ldquo;furever&rdquo; family and is hoping you&rsquo;re looking \"fur\" him!

Rufus loves to play, is so so soft ( like a bunny rabbit, or a soft stuffed animal )and is such a joy to foster.He loves jumping up on your lap and giving you kisses.  He will be missed once he gets adopted.  He also gets along with other cats very well. Rufus would be perfect for an older child, for he is so gentle the only thing is Rufus is shy at first, so it is so important to give him time to get to know you.  Rufus is utd on his distemper shots, wormed, FIV\/FELV neg. and is neutered and has his rabies shot. Rufus will be at Petco, Easton, PA this Saturday  so come down and see him and all the others.

With patients and time I was able to work with her and she actually let me pet her (with a swat here and there). She had 4 beautiful kittens that all got adopted. But also with her kittens she nursed (and saved their lives) 12 other kittens without any mothers. She was absolutely amazing. She just took them as if they were her own. Now its Chanels turn to find a loving home. She is utd on all her shots, wormed, FIV\/FELV neg. and is now spayed. She loves to come up to you and get attention (only when she wants it), once in a while she is a little swatty, (so I do not recommend young children with her). All she needs is a nice quiet place (other cats are just fine for her) where she can be treated like a princess. You can pick her up and nuzzle her but then she wants to be put down. But she will jump up next to you for attention and loves to be petted but does not like her tail touched. Chanel is such a wonderful cat, yes, I have spoiled her with love and she will be fine with an understanding owner.

Our moms were dropped at the home of a very nice lady who kept them both safe, happy and healthy until were were all born.  With the help of some other great people, all my brothers, sisters and friends were cared for, kept healthy and pampered until we were old enough to start looking for our forever homes.  I'm a special boy, and I try to demonstrate it at every opportunity.  Check out the rest of my pictures.  When that photographer lady came in, I posed and posed and posed!  I know what a camera is for, even if my friends are unsure.  She couldn't turn around without finding me posed for the next shot!  I'm a sweet and charming little man.  I knew these photos would be used to help me find that terrific forever home, so I'm not blowing my chances on an unflattering image!

        "about": "The Quincy Animal Shelter is a 100% volunteer-run organization. The Shelter relies completely on our volunteers and the community for support. Incorporated in November 1999 as a non-profit Massachusetts charity, we are also a recognized charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Service code. Since 1999 the Quincy Animal Shelter has placed more than 7,500 cats and dogs into loving and forever homes throughout MA and New England.\n\nAs a \"no kill\" shelter, we make every effort to find the right home for every animal in our care. Every animal receives age-appropriate vaccinations, micro-chipped, and is spayed or neutered before finding its forever family. \n\nDelivering this type of care involves many volunteers, an active and dedicated management and Board, and a lot of money. Our budget runs approximately $250,000 every year in order to keep doing what we do to help the dogs and cats of Quincy. \n\nPlease visit our Volunteer and Wish List pages to find out about ways you can help. Our capacity at the Shelter is limited to a maximum of 12 dogs and 15 to 25 cats, depending on ages and condition of the cats. Our dream is to eventually have a larger facility so that we can continue our mission on a larger scale and serve the continuous needs of the community and the animals.",

        "adoptionProcess": "The first step to adopting is to fill out the Online Adoption Application  at www.rosesrescue.net. After your application has been reviewed and approved, one of our volunteers will get in touch with you. As long as your application has been pre-approved, the pet's foster parent will set up a time with you to come visit the pet you're interested in. In some cases, a home visit may also be required. If all goes well, you will then sign an adoption contract, pay the adoption fee, and then your new pet is ready to go to its forever home!\n\nDogs\nAdoption Fees:\nMixed Breed: $125\nPrison Trained Dogs: $145\nPurebred: $150 no papers $165 w\/papers\n\nAll dogs will be current on shots (EXCEPT Rabies), and be spayed or neutered (if not of age they will come with a certificate to be done within 14 days after coming of age).\n\nCats\nAdoption Fees:\nThe adoption fee for cats is $75.\n\nCats are spayed or neutered (or come with the certificate)and UTD on shots (except for Rabies) and are aids and Leukemia tested.",
        "about": "A small group of volunteers..no paid employees. Our dogs are in area foster homes or they are housed at Rose's..in a heated pole building with a \"bedroom\" (toddler beds, a chair and a radio..so they can keep up on current events) with a dog door to a small fenced area to potty in through out the day and night. Then they get to play in a four acre fenced in area and swim in the pond every day too! We do not have a \"shelter\" per se and only under special circumstances are any of our animals \"kenneled\". They are very well socialized with people and other animals, which makes it much easier to know their temperaments. We do NOT take owner surrenders. But we will do courtesy posts for pets that are vetted and in need of homes. OUR MISSION STATEMENT Rose's Rescue is an all breed rescue for dogs and cats. We primarily concentrate on local pound rescues as we feel these are the animals in the most dire need of a second chance. We are committed to finding the best possible home for each, and every animal that comes into our rescue and we are available to help with any training or behavioral issues for the life of each animal. Rose's Rescue requires that any animal adopted through our organization be returned to us if for any reason the family is no longer able to care for them. Rose's Rescue is also committed to educating the public on the importance of spay and neuter, routine vaccinations, heartworm protection for dogs, and aids and leukemia testing for cats. According to the Humane Society of American over 4 million dogs, cats, kittens and puppies are killed each year. It is our goal to some day see no adoptable pets euthanized.\nEvery two months, Rose\u2019s Rescue chooses a few special candidates for a new class of dogs to be trained at the Trumbull Correctional Institution near Warren, Ohio.  While enrolled in this program, each dog will be trained by selected inmates and overseen by professional dog trainer Bill Oliver (www.customcaninecompany.com) who generously volunteers his time with this laudable project.  Upon completion of their training, cell dogs will have learned important socialization skills, have mastered basic obedience commands, and be fully housebroken.  They will also be taught tricks to entertain their future families and friends, such as sitting pretty, playing dead, and give a high five.  All dogs can be visited (by appointment and accompanied by a Rose\u2019s Rescue representative) while at the prison.  They can be adopted upon graduation, or occasionally sooner if a dog has done exceptionally well and is deemed ready to leave before the class is actually finished.  All of our current cell dogs or graduates are designated as such in their individual descriptions in the \u201cOur Adoptables\u201d section of this website.  If you\u2019d like to get a jump-start on training your new pet, consider adopting a Rose\u2019s Rescue cell dog! ",

        "adoptionProcess": "Adoption Process\nPotential adopters must follow our adoption process begins with an adoption application, an interview, reference check and a home visit.  Adoption Applications may be submitted in advance for pre-approval and will be kept on file.\nBefore completing the adoption application, you should consider the following:\n\u25cf\nLifestyle (house, apartment, single, busy schedule, etc.)\n\u25cf\nPreference of male or female dog or cat\n\u25cf\nDesired personality and energy level (playfulness, calm, dominant, needy, etc.)\n\u25cf\nAppropriate age of the pet for your family.\n\u25cf\nAge of any children you may have. Ordinarily our pets are not suitable for homes with children under 5.\n The Process:\n1.\nSubmit an application. Please allow 1 week for your application to be reviewed.\n2.\nAdoption Applications may be submitted for pre-approval and will be kept on file.\n3.\nInitial interview by phone or email will be made within one week after receipt of your application.\n4.\nWe will then check references; if approved  we will schedule a home visit, the final step in approving your application. All members of your family must be present.\n5.\nAfter home inspection and upon approval, an Adoption Contract will be processed, which includes a two week (14 days) trial period. At this time, the adoption fee will be collected and the trial period will begin. The trial period will allow you to decide if the pet is a good match for you and your family. \n6.\nDuring the two week trial, if you decide that the pet is not a good match, the pet will be returned to \u0093Paws for Seniors\u0094 and the Adoption fee will be refunded. \n7.\nAdoptions fees: Senior Dogs $150.00 Senior Cats $120.00\nA Successful Applicant Must:\n\u25cf\nProvide a loving, humane and safe environment for the \u0093Paws for Seniors\u0094 pet, which includes keeping the dog as an indoor house pet for the remainder of his\/her life.\n\u25cf\nProvide veterinary care and pet meds, including regular vaccinations, heart worm testing and preventative year round, and comply with all local laws regarding licensing.\n\u25cf\nProvide a safe, fenced in yard while the \u0093Paws for Seniors\u0094 dog is outside supervised by you or a family member.\n\u25cf\nAgree to keep the \u0093Paws for Seniors\u0094 dog on a leash when outside a fenced area and not allow him\/her to roam free at any time.\n\u25cf\nConsider all lifestyle changes that can affect your life and your pet: Are your energy levels likely to change soon because of ongoing health issues? If something happens to you, what happens to your pets?\n\u25cf\nReturn the \u0093Paws for Seniors\u0094 pet at any time if the owner is unable to keep him\/her for any reason or if lifestyle changes make the owner unable to maintain above conditions.\n\n\n\n",
        "about": "Paws for Seniors is an all volunteer rescue group in Fauquier County, VA.\nDedicated to caring for and finding homes for senior dogs and cats, aged seven years and older where they can live out their golden years with dignity and love through rescue, foster, adoption, and hospice.\n\nThe Problem\nFor any number of reasons senior dogs and cats are given up by, in many cases, the only family they have ever known.  More often then not, they end up in animal shelters.\nOur Philosophy & Goals\nWe  believe that senior  dogs and cats   deserve a safe and caring environment in which to live out their golden years. We formed, Paws For Seniors, to help find these homeless pets a home where they can live out their remaining days with love and dignity.\nWe do not believe that we are \u0093in competition\u0094 with rescue groups and shelters but \u0093in concert\u0094.  We all have the same goal of helping animals in distress, caring for them, and finding \u0093furever\u0094 homes.   \nWe believe that pet companionship is key to keeping our aging society young at heart! We will work to match senior dogs & cats with senior citizens, while considering the needs of  both.\nWe will work with rescues\/shelters to network and cross-post Senior Dogs and Cats in their care to aid in finding a permanent home.\nWe will establish a network of foster homes, including Senior Citizens to provide a safe and caring environment for pets in need while waiting for their forever homes.  This would be a win-win situation for seniors that would love a pet but cannot afford the expense.  The foster home provides the love and daily care to a Senior Dog or Cat in need. \u0093Paws For Seniors\u0094 provides the food, pet meds and vet care while looking for a forever home.  In some cases our Foster Home providers may become \u0093permanent\u0094 fosters.\nWe will establish a program to aid Senior Citizens to keep the companionship of the pets they currently have.\nWe will work to bring awareness and educate the public on humane animal welfare issues.",

        "about": "City Dogs Rescue was formed to rescue adoptable dogs in high-kill shelters where resources are severely limited.  We want to offer a lifeline to as many of these wonderful pups as possible.  Sadly, nearly all of the dogs that City Dogs Rescue takes in are just days and sometimes hours away from being euthanized, for no reason other than lack of space.  By finding these dogs permanent and loving homes in the DC metropolitan area, we can enrich lives - both human and canine.   ",

If there are any resident animals within the home, it is required that they meet at this time. After the meeting, a home visit by one our representatives is REQUIRED prior to finalizing any adoption and we must meet all members of the household where the pet will be living sometime during the adoption process.  6 month post-adoption check in is completed.",
        "about": "Wags & Whiskers Animal Rescue is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives and finding forever homes for stray, abandoned and surrendered dogs in high kill shelters. We are a small, volunteer run organization. All of our animals listed are in foster homes waiting to be adopted and because of this, we get to know the animals' personalities very well and use this information to match them to an appropriate home. We do not have a physical shelter. This rescue is not funded by public funds nor does it receive many donations so it is dependent on adoption fees to keep operating. We provide all needed supplies and cover medical costs of the foster while it awaits a forever home.",

Most of our dogs require a 6 foot fenced yard. Yards must be cleared of any fox tail weeds.\n\nWe do adopt small dogs to apartments or condo and need to see pictures of the patio or balcony area.\n\nIf you rent, please bring copy of your lease to show you can have pets and any size restrictions.\n\nWe do not adopt to homes with children under the age of five unless we know the history of the dog with young children. All Children MUST be present at adoption.\n\nIf you own a dog and are looking for a friend please bring your dog with you so they can be introduced.\n",

You  could contact  a H.A.L.O. representative through our email: contacthalo@yahoo.com , or by calling H.A.L.O. voicemail at\n925-473-4642.  \n\nNext, we would contact you and arrange for you to bring your dog to to us to evaluate to see if he is a good fit for our adoption program. If he is, we may be able to fit him in to a foster home.  If no foster home is available we may assist you in finding a home by listing him on our site and helping you show him. We will work with you in finding a new safe and loving home for your dog.\nThis example demonstrates just one type of dilemma faced by families.

        "adoptionProcess": "From our website:\nStep 2) An adoption coordinator will contact you, or you may call or email the coordinator listed for more information. Please understand that we are a volunteer organization--we will try to get back to you as soon as possible, usually within 24 hours.\n\nStep 3) Once you have spoken to an adoption coordinator about the pet you are interested in, and if you would like to continue with the adoption process, arrangements will be made for you to meet the pet at his or her foster home.\n\nStep 4) After you have met the dog or cat of your choice, your home visit will be scheduled. The purpose of the home visit is to ensure that the rescue animal will be living in a safe environment, as well as to support the adoption process.\n\nPetConnect reviews applications in order in which they are received. We do, however, focus on matching the right animal to the right family to ensure successful adoptions. These animals have had enough hardship in their lives--our goal is to place these wonderful pets into homes where they will be safe and loved forever.\n\nPetConnect requires an adoption fee for all rescues. This fee helps cover the medical, spay\/neuter, transport and foster expenses incurred in rescuing each animal (our expenses for these rescues almost always exceed our adoption fees). All PetConnect Rescue animals must be spayed or neutered to help stem the vast problem of overpopulation.\n\nAdoption Fees:\nDogs: $250\nCats: $125\n\nPuppies and kittens: Additional $100 deposit\n\nIt is medically advised to spay\/neuter puppies and kittens after six months of age. PetConnect requests a deposit of $100 for puppies and kittens which will be reimbursed with proof of spay\/neuter.\n\nPetConnect will provide discounts for senior pets.",
        "about": "PetConnect Rescue was founded in 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and has evolved into a vibrant animal rescue organization. Our mission is to save the lives of dogs and cats that have been abandoned and place them in loving and permanent homes. On a daily basis, we respond to email and phone pleas for help for dogs and cats imminently slated for euthanasia. We pull these animals into rescue from over extended local shelters as well as rural shelters from West Virginia to Georgia. PetConnect Rescue is non breed specific organization and we are committed to stepping forward whenever we can and wherever there is the greatest need.\n\nPetConnect Rescue arranges for medical services for our rescues, which can range from routine treatments such as vaccinations and blood tests to serious medical conditions such as broken bones and embedded collars. All animals that come thru PetConnect Rescue are spayed or neutered to help stem the terrible problem of pet overpopulation.\n\nThe rescues that come into our care are primarily placed in foster homes. (Some are boarded with reputable kennels or at vet practices as well). Our foster volunteers provide loving care and socialization for these animals while they await their forever homes. Thanks to donation drives we are able to pass on supplies to our foster families such as crates, food, collars, toys, bedding etc\u2026\n\nIn the fall of 2009, The Kyra Macy Foundation joined forces with PetConnect Rescue. As a result of their support we have been able to acquire a 5 acre property in Leesburg, VA which will serve as a sanctuary and wellness center for our rescues. The property is presently undergoing renovations and is expected to be ready to start receiving dogs and cats in the fall of 2010.\n\nThe core mission of PetConnect is to rescue abandoned animals and place them in safe, loving and permanent homes. Time and again, potential adopters tell us that they are willing to wait to adopt from us because of the comfort level they have in working with our organization. We do our utmost to take the nervousness, uncertainty and difficulty out of adopting a pet and support the adoption process every step of the way. The level of volunteerism in all of this is heartwarming. Because of the dedication and commitment of our volunteers we are able to find loving homes for all of these animals who otherwise would not have had a chance.\n\nFrom high kill shelters to foster homes to adoptive families, PetConnect Rescue handles every step of the rescue process.",

The application is then reviewed and if it is deemed a good fit for the animal, it is approved and a meet and greet is arranged. Cats and small animals may be adopted at the time of the meet and greet after an adoption agreement is complete and the adoption fee is paid. Home visits are completed after the meet and greet for dogs. Requirements for each adoption vary depending on the needs of the  individual animals, as we are hoping to make the best and most permanent placement possible. Fees vary depending on the animal being adopted.",
        "about": "Twin Cities Pet Rescue is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit animal rescue focusing on rescuing homeless, abandoned, and abused dogs, cats, and small animals that are overlooked by adopters and even other rescues. These animals are often sick, older or special needs. All of our animals are placed in foster homes for rehabilitation and vetting prior to adoption.",

        "adoptionProcess": "ADOPTION RELEASE AGREEMENT\nIn accepting this animal for adoption, I agree to be bound by the following conditions:\n\nI. I agree to take full responsibility in meeting all of its needs, including providing appropriate food, exercise, grooming and companionship. I will renew any required licenses annually. My new pet will reside in my home. Under no circumstances will this pet be housed outdoors, in a garage, shed or other building other than that which I live, and I will not give away or relinquish ownership of this pet without prior notification to PAS, Inc.\n\nI will not allow my pet to roam at large, and will abide by all City and State animal laws pertaining to my pet.\n\n2. Your new pet has received its vaccinations. Please check with your Veterinarian for regular and necessary veterinary visits and yearly vaccinations to guard against disease. The Parma Animal Shelter, Inc. will not be responsible for any of these fees.\n\n3. There is no guarantee that a healthy-appearing pet is not incubating an illness which may become obvious after you take it home. The Parma Animal Shelter suggests that you take your new pet to your Veterinarian. If within 10 days from the date of adoption a serious health problem is discovered, you may make arrangements to return the animal, along with the Veterinarian's documentation of the illness. You may not return the pet due to behavior or minor health problems. The Parma Animal Shelter, Inc. reserves the right to refuse the return of any animal.\n\n4. To assist the Parma Animal Shelter in acquiring PERMANENT HOMES for its animals and to prevent \"TRYING OUT\" an animal, the adoption fee is non-refundable. No monetary refunds will be given under any circumstances. Parma Animal Shelter Inc. makes no warranty with respect to the temperament of the pet and will not be held responsible for any damages should the pet act in an aggressive manner.\n\n5. Any animal adopted into a multiple pet household should be confined from the rest of the pets for at least 7-10 days This will allow time for any communicable illnesses to appear and be treated by your veterinarian without spreading to other pets.\n\n6. Anyone found in violation of this adoption agreement and who fails to correct the violation within 48 hours, shall forfeit the adopted animal to the Parma Animal Shelter Inc. and be subject to possible fines.\n\n \n\nThe form above is used for every adoption.\n\nThe adoption fee is $85 for dogs and cats with reduction in price on dogs and cats over 7 yrs old to $50.00.   Puppies under 6 months are $100.\n\nDOGS\n \nDogs get: 1 year rabies shot, distemper\/parvo shot, Bordetella vaccine,\nHeartworm test and 1st heartworm pill,  they are  also checked for worms.\nWe take them to the Vet of our choice for spay\/neuter.\n \nAdoption Fee for Cats and Kittens \u0096 updated 1\/30\/2013  KITTENS are combo tested and given FVRCP vaccines until 3 months old (3 weeks apart up to a total of 3 shots). A one-year rabies vaccine (and certificate), blacklighting\/lyme dip (for ringworm prevention), two Advantage Multi treatments and four Pyrantel dewormings are administered as well. Spay\/neuter (through a local Veterinarian) is done when the kitten is three pounds. No kitten can leave the shelter without being spayed or neutered.  CATS are the same as kittens with the exception of a total of two FVRCP vaccines.  No cat can leave the shelter without being spayed or neutered.\n \nWe do not adopt animals as gifts or surprises.  The entire household where the animal will live must be interviewed and adoption application submitted for consideration by the Warden and the adoption committee.  If more than one adoption application is submitted for any animal, the decision is based on what is believed to be the best home available -- NOT first come, first serve.  Animals must be held for 5 days to give the owners a chance to find them.  During this time we can accept applications for adoption in case the owner doesn't come in.  We cannot \"hold\" animals till a decision is made whether to submit an application.  If the animal to be adopted is a dog and there is already a second dog in the household, the adoption counselor will want them to bring their other animals in for an interaction at the shelter so their compatibility can be judged.  There are pamphlets available at the shelter and information on this web site that will inform and advise you in the care of the animal you are adopting.  The volunteers are also available to answer questions you may have prior to and following the adoption.  Our mission is to find loving PERMANENT homes for these animals left homeless through no fault of their own.  The experience of being in a shelter is traumatic and distressing when the animals first come in.  We try very hard to make them comfortable during their stay with us.  Please be sure you research your decision to adopt before you apply.  We do not want to traumatize any of our guests further by causing them to be returned after adoption.",

This can be done online or downloaded and printed out. \n3. Contact Trenton Cats Rescue so we can have a brief conversation with you to determine your needs and preferences, find out about your daily schedule, and talk about your previous experience with pets.\n4. For renters, check with your landlord to ensure that cats are permitted and that you would not be violating any pet restrictions.\n5. We can help determine which cat best fits with your lifestyle or you can visit with one or more that most interest you.\n6. We will do one or more follow up calls after the adoption to check how things are going and address any concerns you may have.\nAdoption fees generally range from $100.00 to $125.00 and vary mostly by the cats age. We also have events that sometimes offer lowered adoption costs. It's a good idea to keep checking back on our website and to \"friend\" us on Facebook to keep up to date on our events. ",

Their personal & veterinarian references will be checked, a home visit conducted then the Foster Parent will set up a meeting where the Adopters will meet the dog. If the adoption is approved, the Adopter will then complete an Adoption Contract and the dog is theirs!\n\nAdoption fees vary. Puppies are $250.00 and Adult Dogs range from $125.00 to $250.00.",
        "about": "Needy Paws Rescue, located in St. Louis, MO, is devoted to saving animals in need, whose lives are in danger at high kill animal shelters & animal controls, those who are strays, have been abandoned or whose family has faced an extreme emergency, regardless of their size or breed. We are a 501(c)3 non-profit organization ran entirely by donations.\n\nOur organization is made up of Volunteers who have been involved in various animal rescues in the St. Louis area and we plan to use our knowledge & experience to make a difference. We believe spaying & neutering is a very important step in keeping pets healthy & happy, plus it helps decrease overpopulation. All of our rescued animals will be spayed or neutered, they will be microchipped to ensure they are identifiable if lost or stolen and they will be current on all of their vaccinations before going to their Forever Homes.\n\nWe are foster-based and all pets stay in approved Foster Homes that have passed inspections, reference checks and are qualified to take care of our rescued animals while they wait for their Forever Family. We are dedicated to finding the best Forever Homes, and will be making home visits and conducting veterinarian checks & reference checks to ensure the pets will have a safe, loving, happy home. Forever Families will be taught how to care for their pet and learn how to get the most out of their relationship with their new family member. \n\nOur rescue is run entirely on donations so if you'd like to donate to help pay for vetting & supplies, we'd be very appreciative! Our PayPal address is donate@needypaws.org or if you'd prefer to donate through a PayPal Donate button, you can find one at www.needypaws.org at the bottom of the page. Thank you!!",

The city of Rockwall contracted with LHS in 2012 to take over managing their animals\/adoptions. They will maintain animal control and we run their vetting and adoptions.  We will screen apps completed at the shelter but we will not be able to due home checks based on staffing constraints. We have 14 employees and funding is done through the city and donations. In Jan 2017 the name of the facility was changed to Rockwall Adoption Center to more clearly divide both sister organizations purpose and services. ",

Each dog rescued is cared for in a safe and nurturing foster care environment where he or she receives appropriate medical care, a high quality diet, training and socialization. To achieve these ends, the organization is involved with transportation, volunteer recruiting and training, mentoring, fund-raising, and establishing and maintaining other programs deemed helpful to achieving the mission of rescuing and re-homing Rat Terriers.

        "about": "Mission and History of Organization\nPet Allies\u0092 Mission is to stop pet over-population by non-lethal means, we do this by providing low cost spay\/neuter services and finding homes for needy pets.  \nPet Allies started out as a small foster-based rescue group, that held adoptions twice a month in front of a local grocery store, and adopted out pets that were not altered, with a $25 \u0091coupon\u0092 off the cost of full service spay\/neuter at local clinics.  A small group of active members wanted to take the organization to another level, and so ran together as a \u0091board\u0092.  They were unanimously elected.  Pet Allies obtained grants, started fundraising through yard sales, and began offering spay\/neuter services to clients who could not afford full prices at local clinics.  After a few years of this, Pet Allies opened a thrift store and began to operate with a steady income stream.  After operating the thrift store for several years, Pet Allies began to look for a property to purchase, that would have enough space to open its own Spay\/Neuter clinic.  A property was found, with 2 buildings, one for the clinic, and one for the thrift store.  The store began operations and a year later the clinic began operations.  In 2012 the clinic altered 2201 animals.  In 2013 mid-year the clinic became self-funding.  It\u0092s in the black!  After four years.  \nIn October of 2012 Pet Allies entered into a contract with the City of Show Low to operate the City\u0092s animal control shelter.  Before working with Pet Allies, the shelter had a euthanasia rate of 90%.  Since Pet Allies has been operating the shelter for the City, no animals have been euthanized due to lack of space.  Less than 20 animals have been euthanized for behavior and\/or medical reasons.  During that time almost 900 animals have come into the shelter.  \nPet Allies realized that it can save 500 to 1000 animals a year by operating the shelter for the City.  It also realized that this gives Pet Allies direct contact and daily contact with clients who need help with spay\/neuter services.  Pet Allies\u0092 focus is to find clients who cannot afford to alter their pets, find a way to make that happen, and to prevent unwanted litters from entering local shelters.  If the pets have already entered the shelter system then its mission is finding them homes.  Pet Allies is determined to keep Show Low a no kill community;  10 months and counting.  Pet Allies is really making an impact in its community.\n",

        "about": "Wags and Walks was founded by Lesley Brog because she knew she could do more for animals. \n\nLesley Brog grew up a veterinarian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, a love for animals present as far back as she can remember. Dogs in particular. But it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until she adopted a Pit Bull puppy, thirteen years ago, that her affinity developed into something much stronger. \n\nAliceA pharmaceutical sales rep by profession, Lesley spent most of her time off volunteering with dog rescue organizations and animal shelters. She was struck by the harsh reality: The majority of the dogs in shelters were healthy, family friendly animals, but due to time and space limitations, many had just five days to be adopted before being euthanized. \n\nAn overachiever with a can-do-anything spirit, Lesley knew that she could do more for animals. So she mustered up the courage to leave the corporate world, and created her own dog rescue organization in Los Angeles, Wags and Walks. Her goal is to educate people about the types of dogs in the shelters and find those animals suitable, loving, fosters and adopters.\n\n392056_2754168612638_225414243_nToday, she visits shelters as far as 60 miles away on a daily basis. She gets to know the animals, takes pictures and video, and urgently networks to find the dogs homes before they run out of time. Lesley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts have been nationally recognized, even resulting in a $10,000 grant from DogTime Media. To date, she has helped save the lives of hundreds of deserving dogs who have brought endless happiness and companionship to their families.\n\nLesley recognizes that despite her best efforts, many thousands more face uncertain fates. She asks that you join her in committing to saving as many lives as possible. Get involved. Adopt, foster, or donate. Together we can change the world, one dog at a time...",

We raise the puppies and take care of the mommies in our volunteers homes.  We take care of these puppies from the time they are born until they are placed.  The mothers are fully vetted prior to their adoption.  All of the adoption fees from the puppies often times go into the mother to get her healthy and ready for a new family.",

The main focus is to rehabilitate animals and prepare the humans prior to adoption. Currently, we are foster based and we use the services of a dog kennel for boarding and daycare purposes. Every animal is unique and requires a different approach to have a successful adoption. There is no one-way approach, therefore, we do not limit our options. Our treatment plans include obedience training, puppy\/kitten training, behavioral modification, socialization, positive reinforcement techniques, problem solving, pet nutrition planning, as well as creating a specialized individual program for specific needs. Ultimately, we aim to transform our animals into model citizens,\u00a0then integrate\u00a0them into the lives of the best matched humans to help guide them.\u00a0\n",

        "about": "Cats In Need of Human Care is a 501C nonprofit, a network of volunteers, with several chapters throughout Orange County.  Each chapter operates individually.  We are Cats In Need of Human Care in Whittier, commonly known as CIN Whittier.  If you are interested in fostering or adopting, please contact us.  The more fosters we have, the more lives we can save!  We also are the only CIN location to have a internship program where middle school and high school students (with adult supervision) come and spend time with cats, allowing them human interaction, exercise, and much needed love.\nCats In Need of Human Care Whittier Chapter services Whittier and the surrounding cities, although we do get people from many different areas interested in adoption.\n\nAdoption fees range from $100-$150.  Fees charges are to cover basic care, food, spay \/ neutering, vaccinations, vet visits costs.  potential adopters are to complete an adoption form and we will determine if you and your desired cat are a good match.  Questions that may be asked:  will your pet be outdoors, declawed, are there other pets or children in the house.\n\nIn the unfortunate event that your beloved kitty does not fit into your home, we require that he\/she be returned to Cats In Need Whittier.\n\nOur adoption hours are every weekend, Saturday and Sunday from noon \u00e2\u0080\u0093 5pm.  We are located inside PetSmart Whittier.\n\nDownload the pet adoption form:\nhttp:\/\/www.catsinneed.com\/downloads\/AdoptionApplication-2013.pdf\n\nCats In Need of Human Care is an organization of volunteers who co-operate with one another and the community to find good, loving homes for homeless pets, promote spay\/neuter and responsible ownership.\nCats in Need is a completely volunteer run organization that focus on adopting kitties into great forever homes.  We showcase our fosters online through our Facebook Page (Cats In Need)  as well as through RescueMe.org & AdoptAPet.com.\n\nWe depend on donations to cover the basics: food, medical care (shots and spay\/neuter) for the kitties until they go home to their new families. With the shelters overtaxed, many of these kitties would likely be killed due to sheer population overload and not enough public funds to support them.\n\nHelp us help the kitties!",
