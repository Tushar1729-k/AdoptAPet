She&rsquo;s just over a year old,&nbsp;only 30 pounds. April is getting prettier&nbsp;every day. April has a very sweet &amp; gentle spirit. She loves to curl up on a chair or doggie bed. She has proven to have LOTS of personality. April is one adorable little lady &amp; I think whoever adopts her will be so happy that you found this little treasure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 14pt;\">Given that she had been outside her whole young life, her ears are both fly-blown which means that flies ate the tips of her ears -- but she&rsquo;s all healed now! When she arrived her coat was super dry &amp; looked like an old dirty rug --- but she has been fed <a href=\"http://www.freshpet.com/\">www.Freshpet.com</a>&nbsp;exclusively to help her gain her strength &amp; now her coat finally has a lovely sheen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 14pt;\">April&rsquo;s had a very hard life&nbsp;in KY. Her Mom &amp; siblings were captured by animal control, but she escaped. Thankfully a very nice lady named &ldquo;April&rdquo; spent several days trying to capture her &amp; finally she did. I saw her picture and she looked so terribly sad,&nbsp;I just wanted to bring her to DE, so I could make her feel loved, safe &amp; smile &ndash; yes dogs do smile!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 14pt;\">Because the \"family\"&nbsp;in KY left her Mom &amp; her siblings outside their whole life when April arrived, we found she had a very odd disease. It was the 1st time&nbsp;my Vet had ever had to treat it here in our area.&nbsp; It's called <strong>Canine blastomycosis</strong> &amp; it's something that she contracted in KY. We're&nbsp;still treating it&nbsp;aggressively. This disease also caused a cataract in one of her eyes, but she can see fine. Her disease is not&nbsp;contagious to humans or other animals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 14pt;\">She's not sickly as you can see in the video, she's active, plays with the other dogs and her extremely affectionate &amp; just a very sweet &amp; gentle little lady.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 14pt;\">For more info read our adoption requirements &amp; if you can meet or exceed them, you can apply here at my website. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 14pt;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">All LnF pups/dogs have been temperament tested &amp; live in foster homes ~ All pups and dogs have been housebroken (puppies are paper trained) &amp; crated trained ~&nbsp;All pups/dogs have been Microchipped ~ Tested for Heartworm, Ehrlichia &amp; Lyme ~ Each dog is on Heartworm Medication year-round while in our care ~ Up to date with Rabies ~ Distemper, Parvo &amp; Leptospirosis vaccines&nbsp;~ Wormed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 14pt;\" data-mce-mark=\"1\">&nbsp;Our adoption fee includes (30) days of FREE pet insurance with an option to purchase, but it's your choice.&nbsp;We strive to provide the BEST medical care available so that YOU are assured all our pups/dogs are healthy, up-to-date on all necessary shots,&nbsp;spayed or neutered&nbsp;by our&nbsp;rescue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,times; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong>Adoption Requirements:&nbsp; *A minimum physical 4-foot high fence or is higher is always mandatory and must be installed.</strong> Some dogs may need a 6-foot wood or vinyl fence &amp; if so it's noted on their profile.
