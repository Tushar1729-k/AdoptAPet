There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study [[equine coat color genetics]], as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the [[leopard complex]] mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop [[equine recurrent uveitis]] and [[Nyctalopia|congenital stationary night blindness]]; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.\n\nArtwork depicting prehistoric horses with leopard spotting exists in prehistoric [[cave painting]]s in Europe. Images of [[domestication of the horse|domesticated horses]] with leopard spotting patterns appeared in artwork from [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Han dynasty]] China through the [[early modern period]]. In North America, the [[Nez Perce people|Nez Perce]] people of what today is the United States [[Pacific Northwest]] developed the original American breed. [[American pioneer|Settlers]] once referred to these spotted horses as the \"Palouse horse\", possibly after the [[Palouse River]], which ran through the heart of Nez Perce country. Gradually, the name evolved into ''Appaloosa''.\n\nThe Nez Perce lost most of their horses after the [[Nez Perce War]] in 1877, and the breed fell into decline for several decades. A small number of dedicated breeders preserved the Appaloosa as a distinct breed until the [[Appaloosa Horse Club]] (ApHC) was formed as the [[breed registry]] in 1938. The modern breed maintains bloodlines tracing to the [[foundation bloodstock]] of the registry; its partially [[Breed registry#Open|open stud book]] allows the addition of some [[Thoroughbred]], [[American Quarter Horse]] and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] blood.\n\nToday, the Appaloosa is one of the most popular breeds in the United States; it was named the official [[List of U.S. state horses|state horse]] of [[Idaho]] in 1975. It is best known as a [[stock horse]] used in a number of [[western riding]] disciplines, but is also a versatile breed with representatives seen in many other types of [[equestrianism|equestrian]] activity. Appaloosas have been used in many movies; an Appaloosa is the mascot for the [[Florida State Seminoles]]. Appaloosa bloodlines have influenced other horse breeds, including the [[Pony of the Americas]], the [[Nez Perce Horse]], and several [[List of gaited horse breeds|gaited horse]] breeds.\n\n== Breed characteristics ==\n\n[[File:Sclera and mottling.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mottling on the skin is particularly visible around the eyes and muzzle. The sclera of an Appaloosa's eye is white.|alt=The head of a light-colored horse with dark spots, showing spotting around the skin of the eye and muzzle.]]\n\nThe Appaloosa is best known for its distinctive, leopard complex-spotted coat, which is preferred in the breed. Spotting occurs in several overlay patterns on one of several recognized base [[Horse coat color|coat colors]]. There are three other distinctive, \"core\" characteristics: [[mottle]]d skin, striped hooves, and eyes with a white [[sclera]].<ref name=\"ApHCrules\">{{cite web | url = http://www.appaloosa.com/registration/handbook.htm| title= 2012 Appaloosa Horse Club Handbook |publisher=Appaloosa Horse Club|access-date=April 2, 2011|format=PDF| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110422185434/http://appaloosa.com/registration/handbook.htm| archive-date= 22 April 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nSkin mottling is usually seen around the muzzle, eyes, anus, and genitalia.<ref name=Rule128/> Striped hooves are a common trait, quite noticeable on Appaloosas, but not unique to the breed.<ref name=\"Identify\" />  The sclera is the part of the eye surrounding the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]; although all horses show white around the eye if the eye is rolled back, to have a readily visible white sclera with the eye in a normal position is a distinctive characteristic seen more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds.<ref name=\"Identify\" /> Because the occasional individual is born with little or no visible spotting pattern, the ApHC allows \"regular\" registration of horses with mottled skin plus at least one of the other core characteristics.

Then, 18th-century European bloodlines were added, particularly those of the \"pied\" horses popular in that period and shipped ''en masse'' to the Americas once the color had become unfashionable in Europe.{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=391}} These horses were similar to a tall, slim [[Thoroughbred]]-[[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] type of horse popular in [[Enlightenment in Spain|Bourbon-era Spain]].{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=391}}{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=170}} The original Appaloosa tended to have a convex facial profile that resembled that of the [[warmblood]]-[[Jennet]] crosses first developed in the 16th century during the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=392}}{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=308}}\n\nThe old-type Appaloosa was later modified by the addition of draft horse blood after the 1877 defeat of the Nez Perce, when U.S. Government policy forced the Native Americans to become farmers and provided them with draft horse mares to breed to existing stallions.{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=392}} The original Appaloosas frequently had a sparse [[mane (horse)|mane]] and [[tail (horse)|tail]], but that was not a primary characteristic, as many early Appaloosas did have full manes and tails.{{sfn|Richardson, ''Appaloosa''|pp=27–28}} There is a possible genetic link between the leopard complex and sparse mane and tail growth, although the precise relationship is unknown.{{sfn|Sponenberg, ''Equine Color Genetics''|pp=90–91}}\n\nAfter the formation of the Appaloosa Horse Club in 1938, a more modern type of horse was developed after the addition of [[American Quarter Horse]] and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] bloodlines. The addition of Quarter Horse lines produced Appaloosas that performed better in [[horse racing|sprint racing]] and in [[halter (horse show)|halter]] competition. Many cutting and reining horses resulted from old-type Appaloosas crossed on Arabian bloodlines, particularly via the Appaloosa [[foundation bloodstock|foundation stallion]] Red Eagle.{{sfn|Bennett, ''Conquerors''|p=393}} An infusion of Thoroughbred blood was added during the 1970s to produce horses more suited for racing.{{sfn|Harris, ''Horse Breeds of the West''|p=12}} Many current breeders also attempt to breed away from the sparse, \"rat tail\" trait, and therefore modern Appaloosas have fuller manes and tails.{{sfn|Richardson, ''Appaloosa''|pp=27–28}}\n\n== Color and spotting patterns ==\n\n{{see also|Equine coat color}}\n[[File:AppaloosaCharlie.jpg|thumb|Few spot leopard Appaloosa with wet coat showing \"halo\" effect of dark skin under white coat around spots.]]\n\nThe coat color of an Appaloosa is a combination of a base color with an overlaid spotting pattern.
